# So what are HTML5 semantic elements? 
Let's start with the basics. The definition of **semantics**, is the meaning of a word, phrase, sentence, or text. It's the understanding of the meaning and logic behind the subject. Where as **semantic elements** are elements that clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. 

Examples of semantic HTML elements include: header tags `<h1>` through `<h6>`, `<blockquote>`, `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` -- All of which clearly defines its content. 

# Why should we use them?
The goal of semantic elements is to aid in communication and provide information about the context of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page. In HTML4, developers used their own id and class names to style elements. This made it impossible for search engines to identify the correct web page contents. With HTML5 esemantic elements (i.e.: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc., it has become easier.)

Using semantic tags gives you many more hooks for styling your content. For example, today today you want all of your `<blockquote>` to be called out with a yellow background, but tomorrow you decided to change that to grey background with blue font color. If you have all of your code samples defined with semantic code tags, then it becomes very easy to change the complete style of your page. 

# How to use semantic tags
Semantic tags should be used to convey meaning rather than for the purpose of presentation. Understanding their purpose instead of using therm for their common display properties is the key.
