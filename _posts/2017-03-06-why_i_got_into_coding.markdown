From fidgeting with HTML and copying open source to manipulate code, I've always found it fascinating and empowering to create and change the appearance of web. It took me time to rediscover and realize that getting into coding on a deeper level can be my next learning journey. We live in an always-connected society of constant web/mobile use and I want to be apart of this movement to impact and help people by building better software. I want to challenge myself to solve bigger problems and to figure out better processes while fulfilling my curiosity to create. Learning to code would give me the power to build new things and foster creativity.
